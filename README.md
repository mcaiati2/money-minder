# Money Minder

## Description

 MoneyMinder is a financial application that allows users to track their personal budget. It can log expenses and store info about them - a description, the cost amount, and the date it was made on. The user can set their target goal for their budgeting period, and then compare the growing total of expenses they log against that goal over time.

Our motivation was to create an elegent digital solution for staying on top of monthly expenses. We plan to achieve this by continuously building on our knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript. The ultimate goal of this application is to empower users to achieve financial freedom. We learned the importance of keeping an organized repository while collaborating with a development team.

## Usage

**Add New Expense/Credit My Balance Button:** <br>
This button is used to enter a positive or negative value to add or subtract from your current balance. Once you click the button, type the category, expense amount, and date of the expense. If you'd like to add a credit amount to your balance, enter the value as a negative number. To reset your total balance when the new month rolls over, enter the exact amount of your current balance as a negative value. This will set the value back to 0 for the new month.<br><br>

**Adjust Monthly Limit:** <br>
This button allows you to enter a dollar amount so so that you can visually see what you have set your monthly balance to be. Once the amount is logged, it will appear at the top of your home page alongside the total. You can change this to a new limit at  any time by clicking the button again and setting a new limit.<br>
